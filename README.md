   This will start the FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### **2. Run the Streamlit Frontend**:
- In another terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the `streamlit_app.py` file and run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

   This will start the Streamlit app on `http://localhost:8501`.
